Water hydraulic experiments focus on the assessment of the hydraulic characteristics of water which plays a greater role in the development of hydro power plants. 
The experiments include Surface flow measurements, Venturi tube/ Bernoulli principle verification experiments and Archimedes principle verification based on weight and atmospheric pressure measurements experiments. Models are miniaturized and printed on a 3D printer for demonstration purposes.By using demonstration models, learners acquire fundamental scientific concepts and principles used to build water hydraulic related complex systems. However, the verification models fit in a bag. The printed models are used to take measurements and the collected data are used to verify scientific principles.
