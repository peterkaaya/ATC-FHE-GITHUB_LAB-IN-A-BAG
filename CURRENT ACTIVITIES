Water hydraulics experiements

Water hydraulic experiments focus on the assessment of the hydraulic characteristics of water which plays a greater role in the development of hydro power plants. 
The experiments include Surface flow measurements, Venturi tube/ Bernoulli principle verification experiments and Archimedes principle verification based on weight and 
atmospheric pressure measurements experiments. 
Models are miniaturized and printed on a 3D printer for demonstration purposes.
By using demonstration models, learners acquire fundamental scientific concepts and principles used to build water hydraulic related complex systems. 
However, the verification models fit in a bag. The printed models are used to take measurements and the collected data are used to verify scientific principles.

Water Quality and waste water treatmentSince water is a vital resource for health and agriculture, this project also focuses on this area. Studies for water quality are such that the campus water and the Kikuletwa campus water map is established showing the quality of the water for communal use. Water maps are created by taking Calorimetric experiments to assess the composition of the water around ATC campuses.The composition of the water mineral elements is measured by considering the standard solution curves. Any discrepancy in the water quality is measured against the standard curves.Studies has been done to assess the waste water composition after treatment. Assessment focuses on the elimination of heavy metals which may have health side effect when the treated waste water is taken back to the river for irrigation purposes.Through the project, a study area was selected to assess the quantity of the produced solid waste per day and propose ways to manage sold wastes to protect the environmental.
